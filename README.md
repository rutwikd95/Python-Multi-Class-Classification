# Python-Multi-Class-Classification
### Classification of the Iris Data set using "One vs all" or "One vs rest" Logistic Regression classification and K-Nearest Neighbors Classification and Comparing their testing accuracies. 

In this python notebook, I have used the Scikit-Learn's Iris Data Set which consists of the following features: 
- sepal length in cm

- sepal width in cm

- petal length in cm

- petal width in cm

- class:
        - Iris-Setosa
        - Iris-Versicolour
        - Iris-Virginica
        
##### Applying Logistic Regression, gives an accuracy of 93%

##### Applying K-Nearest Neighbors with a K value of K=6 gives 95% Accuracy

##### Applying K-Nearest Neighbors with a K value of K=1 gives 96% Accuracy

We then plot a graph of Testing Accuracies of all the K values from 1 to 20 and check which K values give maximum Accuracy.
